# Namespaces

Namespaces provide a scope for Kubernetes resources, carving up your cluster in smaller units. You can think of it as a workspace you're sharing with other users. Many resources such as pods and services are namespaced. Others, such as nodes, are not namespaced, but are instead treated as cluster-wide. As a developer, you'll usually use an assigned namespace, however admins may wish to manage them, for example to set up access control or resource quotas.

Namespace provides an additional qualification to a resource name. This is helpful when multiple teams are using the same cluster and there is a potential of name collision. It can be as a virtual wall between multiple clusters.

# Functionality of Namespace

Following are some of the important functionalities of a Namespace in Kubernetes âˆ’

- Namespaces help pod-to-pod communication using the same namespace.
- Namespaces are virtual clusters that can sit on top of the same physical cluster.
- They provide logical separation between the teams and their environments.


# Create a Namespace

The following command is used to create a namespace.

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata
    name: black_world

In the above code,

- We are using the command to create a namespace.
- This will list all the available namespace.
- This will get a particular namespace whose name is specified in the command.
- This will describe the complete details about the service.
- This will delete a particular namespace present in the cluster.

Using Namespace in Service - Example
Following is an example of a sample file for using namespace in service.

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
    name: blackworld
    namespace: black_world
    labels:
        component: new
    spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
    selector:
        component: new
    ports:
    - name: http
        port: 9200
        protocol: TCP
    - name: transport
        port: 9300
        protocol: TCP

In the above code, we are using the same namespace under service metadata with the name of blackworld.
